QUEUE IMPLEMENTATION USING A LINEAR ARRAY AND A CIRCULAR ARRAY

A. LINEAR ARRAY
	As we dequeue elements fron the array we increase the size by 1 
to take care of the space left and maximize the total size usage.

*****WITHIN THE CODE THERE ARE COMMENTS WHICH GUIDE WHY THE LINES ARE 
     WRITTEN THAT WAY OR WHICH EXPLAINS THE CODE LINES*****

B. CIRCULAR ARRAY
	Here the size of the queue is being maintained kept fixed and the
addition of new items is being done in a circular manner. Lets say we have 
added items till we have reached the limit i.e size and there are empty spaces 
behind due to the fact that we have dequeued items, we go back and fill those 
spaces. Further explanation of the code is done in comments
